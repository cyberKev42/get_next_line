# get_next_line
Creation of a function that reads from a file or the standard input, one line at a time.

In this project I learned about static variables and how to use it to store data over multiple calls of the same function.
This function is able to read a file line by line until the end of file.
It is also possible to read from multiple files interchangeably without losing or mixing up any data in the bonus part of the project.
